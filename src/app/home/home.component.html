<h1>What is The Pomodoro Technique?</h1>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as
    a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">student</a>.
